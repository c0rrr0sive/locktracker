POST BODY (for r/PrizePicks):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey everyone,

I've been playing PrizePicks for about a year and realized something embarrassing - I had no idea if I was actually up or down overall. I'd win some, lose some, but never tracked it properly.

I tried using spreadsheets but honestly I'd forget to update them after a few days. So I built a tool to do it automatically.

**What it does:**
- Chrome extension that reads your bet history from PrizePicks
- One click imports all your bets to a dashboard
- Shows your actual win rate, ROI, and total profit/loss
- Breaks down your stats by sport so you can see what's working

**It's free** (15 syncs/month on free plan, unlimited on Pro for $9/mo).

**What it's NOT:**
- It doesn't access your login or make bets for you
- It just reads the bet history page and saves your data
- Your info stays private

I built this for myself but figured others might find it useful. Would love feedback if anyone tries it.

Chrome extension: [link when approved]

Happy to answer any questions!

POST BODY (for r/sportsbook - more analytical angle):

Built a free tool to track betting performance automatically

Got tired of maintaining spreadsheets to track my props on PrizePicks, so I built a Chrome extension that imports bet history automatically.

**Features:**
- Auto-imports from PrizePicks (FanDuel/DraftKings coming soon)
- Tracks win rate, ROI, units won/lost
- Analytics by sport, bet type
- All data is private/encrypted

Free tier gets 15 syncs/month. Been using it for my own tracking and it's been eye-opening to see actual numbers vs what I thought my record was.

Link if anyone wants to try: locktracker.app

Feedback welcome - still adding features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST BODY (for r/SideProject - builder angle):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I built a bet tracking app because I was too lazy to use spreadsheets

**The problem:** I bet on PrizePicks (sports props) but never actually knew if I was profitable. Spreadsheets lasted about 3 days before I stopped updating them.

**The solution:** Chrome extension that reads your bet history and syncs it to a dashboard automatically.

**Tech stack:**
- Flask backend
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth)
- Vanilla JS frontend (no framework, keeping it simple)
- Chrome extension with content scripts
- Deployed on Railway

**Business model:**
- Free tier: 15 syncs/month
- Pro: $9/month for unlimited + auto-sync
- Stripe for payments

**Current status:**
- Live at locktracker.app
- Extension pending Chrome Web Store review
- ~0 users (just launched)

Would love feedback from anyone who bets on sports or has built similar tracking tools.

FOLLOW-UP CONTENT IDEAS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- "After tracking 100 bets, here's what I learned about my betting patterns"

- Share interesting insights from your own data
- Answer questions others have about tracking

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENTS TO PREPARE FOR:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: "Is this safe? Will PrizePicks ban me?"
A: "It just reads the page like you do - doesn't automate anything or violate ToS. It's the same as copying your bets to a spreadsheet, just automated."

Q: "Why would I pay when I can use a spreadsheet?"
A: "You probably won't update a spreadsheet consistently (I didn't). The free tier is enough for casual tracking. Pro is for people who bet frequently and want auto-sync."

Q: "How do I know you won't steal my data?"
A: "The extension never sees your password. It only reads the bet history page after you're already logged in. All data is encrypted. Check the privacy policy."

Q: "When is FanDuel/DraftKings coming?"
A: "Working on it - need to build the parsers for their bet history pages. PrizePicks was first because that's what I use."
